# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – A Modern Teaching Course**! This book is designed to guide students, researchers, and enthusiasts through the exciting intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, focusing especially on humanoid robots.

Humanoid robotics represents a frontier where machines mimic human form and capabilities. By combining AI with robotics, these machines can perceive, reason, and act in the real world—bringing AI from abstract algorithms into tangible, physical systems.

## Why Study Physical AI?

- **Real-World Applications**: From healthcare and eldercare robots to autonomous assistants, physical AI systems are increasingly integrated into daily life.
- **Bridging Theory and Practice**: Unlike purely software AI, physical AI challenges us to consider sensors, actuators, and human-robot interactions.
- **Innovative Research Opportunities**: Designing intelligent, adaptive, and interactive robots requires a deep understanding of AI, control systems, and robotics principles.

## Who Is This Book For?

- **Students & Learners**: Anyone studying AI, robotics, or mechatronics.
- **Researchers & Practitioners**: Professionals exploring humanoid robotics and physical AI applications.
- **Hobbyists & Enthusiasts**: Those fascinated by AI and robotics and eager to experiment with humanoid robots.

## How This Book Is Structured

The book is divided into several chapters, starting from foundational concepts in robotics, AI algorithms for physical systems, sensors and actuators, humanoid robot design, and practical experiments. Each chapter is designed to build upon the previous ones, gradually guiding you from theory to hands-on implementation.

> **Tip:** Each chapter includes diagrams, examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding.
